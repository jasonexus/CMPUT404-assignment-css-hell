=============
I did not collaborate with any other students upon completing this assignment.


Part 1 Modifications
====================

- I added a header tag to wrap around the name of each of the books which I then styled in the CSS file. I styled the headers to be 4em in font-size.
- I changed the font from Times New Roman to Georgia
- Wrapped the eBook licensing in a div, gave it class name license, centered the text, and made it bold
- For 1.html and 2.html, I wrapped all the preliminary information about each book in a div tag with the class name "intro-text" which I then centered and made bold using css.
- Set the background color to #fafafa
- I changed all the paths to the required images for all of the html files since I am using an images folder inside the ./gutenberg
- Changed the link tag to style the css from an external stylesheet. Instead of href="coverpage", the href is now "stylesheet"
- For 1.html and 2.html, I wrapped the contents section inside a div tag with the class named "contents" which I then centered. I did the same for the illustrations section for both html files and gave the div the class name "illustrations"
- I added a shaking animation for the images that shakes infinitely
- Changed background colour to a soft blue-green gradient
- Styled image captions with colour 'rosy-brown'
